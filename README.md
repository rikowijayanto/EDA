### Exploratory Analysis for Mining
Based on the Jiawei Han, dkk. Exploratory data analysis can be used to do preprocessing data in data mining process. There are three main process that we have to do :
1. Data cleansing/cleaning (missing value, etc)
2. Data integration and reduction (PCA, SVM, etc)
3. Data transformation/normalization
